        This app is designed to store your bar\'s bottles in a horizontally scrolling library as well as retrieve recipes from an
        online repository. You can save these online recipes for offline viewing with the favorite button within each recipe card.
        The app will also recommend new recipes for you to discover based on the bottles that are in your bar library to save you
        scrolling through the entire list. Future updates to the list will be downloaded when a good internet connection is established.\n\nCheers!
